            <h2>Background & Education</h2>
            <p>My name is Alazar. I grew up in Addis Ababa where curiosity and a love for learning were fostered from an early age. My childhood was filled with adventures and endless questions about how things worked, which naturally led me to develop a keen interest in technology. During high school, I discovered my passion for programming and spent countless hours tinkering with code and creating small projects. This fascination with technology guided me to pursue a degree in software engineering at Addis Ababa university. At university, I honed my skills in software development, explored various programming languages, and worked on diverse projects that challenged and expanded my understanding of the field. My academic journey was marked by dedication, collaboration with peers, and a continuous drive to innovate and solve complex problems. </p>
